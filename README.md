# CivicEye
Project Title: Civic Eye – AI-Based Civic Issue Detection and Grievance Redressal System
Project Area: Artificial Intelligence (Computer Vision, NLP), Smart Cities, Web Development, Civic Technology
Problem Statement: Civic issues like potholes, garbage accumulation, broken infrastructure, and water leakage often remain unreported or unresolved due to the lack of a user-friendly and transparent reporting system. Existing manual processes are slow, inaccessible to common citizens, and often disconnected from real-time issue resolution. This results in poor public satisfaction and degraded urban quality of life.
Objective: To develop an AI-powered platform that allows citizens to report civic problems using images, text, or voice. The system will detect the issue type using machine learning, auto-tag its location, verify the authenticity of the report, and automatically forward it to the concerned civic authority. A status tracker will also be included to promote transparency and accountability.
Methodology:
•	Frontend: Web interface (and optional mobile app) for users to submit complaints via image, text, or voice.
•	Computer Vision: CNN-based image classifier to detect issue types like potholes, garbage, etc.
•	NLP Module: Classifies text/voice-transcribed complaints using TF-IDF or BERT models.
•	Fake Detection: Rule-based and ML models to detect spam or duplicate complaints.
•	Geolocation: Auto-detect complaint location using device GPS.
•	Backend: Flask-based REST API for model integration and database storage.
•	Complaint Tracker: Track progress (Submitted → In Progress → Resolved).
•	Admin Dashboard (optional): For authority-side review and management
Expected Outcome:
•	An intelligent, AI-driven civic issue reporting platform.
•	Improved public engagement and faster issue redressal.
•	Transparent and efficient communication between citizens and civic authorities.
•	Scalable framework for smart cities or local governments.
Tools and Technologies:
•	Programming: Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
•	AI/ML: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, HuggingFace Transformers
•	Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (or Flutter)
•	Database: Firebase or MongoDB
APIs: Google Maps API, Speech Recognition.
